# Security Practices and SOC2 Compliance Measures

This document outlines the security practices and SOC2 compliance measures implemented in the Connected Vehicle Platform project. Our goal is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our infrastructure and data.

## AWS Security Best Practices

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **Use of IAM Roles and Policies**: Ensure that IAM roles are used for AWS service access and that policies are least privilege.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all IAM users with console access.

### 2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Subnetting**: Use public and private subnets to segregate resources that are exposed to the internet from those that are not.
- **Security Groups**: Implement security groups as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### 3. Data Encryption
- **Encryption at Rest**: Use AWS services like Amazon S3 and EBS volumes that support encryption at rest.
- **Encryption in Transit**: Ensure that data is encrypted in transit using TLS across all services.

## SOC2 Compliance

### 1. Security
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to systems and data, including physical and logical access.
- **Network Security Controls**: Use firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and regular vulnerability scanning.

### 2. Availability
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Maintain a disaster recovery plan with regular testing.
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement automated backup solutions and ensure that data can be restored within a reasonable timeframe.

### 3. Processing Integrity
- **Data Validation**: Use input validation to ensure the processing integrity of the data.
- **Error Detection and Correction**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect and correct errors.

### 4. Confidentiality
- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity and apply controls accordingly.
- **Data Access Controls**: Limit access to confidential data to authorized users only.

### 5. Privacy
- **Data Privacy**: Adhere to data protection laws and regulations, ensuring that personal data is collected, processed, and stored securely.

## Implementation in Terraform and Ansible

- **Terraform**: Use Terraform to provision AWS resources with security groups, IAM roles, and policies that adhere to the security best practices mentioned above.
- **Ansible**: Use Ansible roles to configure EC2 instances following the security configurations, ensuring that software and services are up-to-date and configured securely.

## Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

- **Audit Logs**: Enable and monitor AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config logs for continuous security auditing.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update this document and the security measures as new threats emerge and as AWS services evolve.

By adhering to these practices and measures, the Connected Vehicle Platform aims to maintain a secure and compliant infrastructure and application.
